                    <p>Welcome to the <strong>SARIT</strong> website. Here you will find electronic editions of Sanskrit and other Indian-language texts. These are documented, dated and have embedded notes about their change history, so that they can be publicly cited and used with confidence as scholarly sources. The editions in the <strong>SARIT</strong> library currently include <a href="http://sarit.indology.info/newphilo/search3t?dbname=indologica&amp;word=&amp;OUTPUT=conc&amp;CONJUNCT=PHRASE&amp;DISTANCE=3&amp;title=&amp;author=">these works.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>This website also currently offers tools for text search, retrieval and analysis of the works in the <strong>SARIT</strong> library. You can search for a single word, phrase, words that occur in the same paragraph, and so forth. You can generate an index of terms, a KWIC index, and word-frequency lists.</p>
                    <p>You can <a title="SARIT: Text Archive Downloads" href="/downloads.shtml"> download</a> all the texts at <strong>SARIT</strong>. They are licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons license</a>.  Once downloaded, you can use services such as <a href="http://oxgarage.oucs.ox.ac.uk:8080/ege-webclient/">OxGarage</a> to convert the files to a format that is useful to you, for example PDF, HTML, or for reading on an ebook like the Kindle.</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The <a target="_blank" title="TLG" href="http://www.tlg.uci.edu/">Thesaurus Linguae Graecae</a>
                        was founded in 1972.  Its subsequent growth as a sophisticated research tool, and the projects derived from it,
                        such as <a target="_blank" title="Perseus" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/">PERSEUS</a>,
                        demonstrated compellingly that
                        a corpus of classical texts in machine-readable format could be
                        vitally important for the study of language, art, history and culture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The history of <strong>SARIT</strong> looks back to a meeting convened by Prof. Richard Lariviere
                        at the University of Texas in 1988 that brought together many specialists interested in creating a
                        "TLG for Indic," i.e., a corpus  of machine-readable texts in Indian languages. The
                        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.academia.edu/360194/Report_on_the_Sanskrit_Text_Archive_Conference_Austin_Texas_October_28-29_1988">minutes of that meeting</a> still make interesting reading today,
                        and lay out some of the rationales underlying the present project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the Texas
                        meeting, the <a target="_blank" title="INDOLOGY" href="http://indology.info">INDOLOGY</a> website began to make electronic texts of
                        Sanskrit works available in an ad-hoc manner.  This effort was highly successful, but there remained problems of format normalization, non-standard fonts and character encodings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many of these
                        problems were insoluble at the time. Things have moved forward since 1988, especially in corpus linguistics, computer networking, and encoding standards.  SARIT takes advantage of all these new developments, especially Unicode, XML and the Text Encoding Initiative.

                    <h2>What makes SARIT different?</h2>
                    <p>The main difference between
                        this collection of Sanskrit and other Indic-language texts
                        and others is that these texts are marked up ("tagged") using the
                        rich Text Encoding Initiative ("TEI") system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        TEI is a way of tagging files that was
                        designed by humanities scholars for humanities scholars.  It is capabable of building
                        a great deal of intelligence
                        into the file itself, so that a TEI-file can later serve many purposes and remains
                        flexible and useful in the long term.  TEI files contain their own history, so you can
                        always find out where the file came from, how and when it has been
                        updated, and how it relates to printed editions, manuscripts or other sources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a gentle introduction to the TEI, see the excellent
                        <a target="_blank" title="TEI by Example website" href="http://www.teibyexample.org/">TEI by Example website</a>
                        The files in this language corpus can be considered
                        as electronic editions, and can be cited
                        as such in scholarly research publications.  <strong>SARIT</strong> texts
                        respect copyright and are licensed appropriately to allow
                        free academic use.  Furthermore, <strong>SARIT</strong> makes its TEI

                    <p>The standardized TEI format used for encoding the files in the <strong>SARIT</strong> library means that other interfaces and toolsets are possible and may be implemented in future.
