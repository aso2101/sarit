                <h3>Indexes and Searching</h3>
                <section>
                    <div><!--<h4>Indexes</h4>--><p>In contrast to search in a word processing
                            document, search in a database goes through an index. Just as in the
                            index to a book, terms are extracted from the text and arranged in a
                            list where each item is keyed to certain positions in the text. When
                            searching a database, the search terms are matched against the index and
                            the parts of the text that contain the terms are then displayed.</p>
                        <p>Sanskrit can be written in various acripts; in SARIT, Devanagari script
                            and IAST romanisation are used. To the database, the fact that different
                            scripts are used does not matter - they are treated in the same way, as
                            Unicode characters. However, no matter whether Devanagari or
                            romanisation is used, there are differences in the way texts
                            aresegmented, that is, how texts are divided by the use of spaces (and
                            other characters) into words. This is of great importance when searching
                            SARIT texts, for one kind of indexes suit texts that are divided (more
                            or less) into words and another kind suits texts that (more or less) are
                            written as one long string of characters. The first of these, the word
                            index, is Lucene Full-Text index, and the second, the string index, is
                            the Ngram index.</p>
                        <p>Different kinds of indexes means different search options. With a word
                            index, you can, e.g., search for contexts in which a number of words are
                            close to each other, regardless of their order, but with a string index,
                            this is not easily possible. With a string index, you can use wildcards,
                            but you basically search for what is there, that is, what you input as
                            your search term is what you will retrieve. The important thing here is
                            that if you use the string index, you will retrieve instances in which
                            your search string occurs inside a longer string in the text, whereas if
                            you use the word index (and do not use wildcards), you will find only
                            instances in the text that are identical to your search string.</p>
                        <p>All texts are indexed in both ways and you choose which index to use.
                            Since not all texts divide strings into words, you should choose the
                            index that is most suited for your text. This is not done
                            automatically.</p>
                        <p>All the texts are marked up according to the TEI Guidelines. A text
                            marked up in this way basically divides into a header describing the
                            text edition and the edition/text proper. The header, being written
                            mostly in English, will have standard word divisions, so here the word
                            index and its associated search options will be profitable to use, but
                            the way word division is implemented in the text proper differs from
                            text to text.</p>
                        <p>However, though there are these differences, if you are looking simply
                            for a string match of a single search term, use the defaults and search
                            using the string index, optionally with the regex methods described in
                                <a href="search-help-ngram">NGram Search</a>. This is easiest and
                            very fast. If the text is suited for this being divided into words, use
                            the word index and its many options. Now, to complicate matters, the
                            Lucene Full-Text Index has quite advanced regex options, described in <a
                                href="search-help-lucene-regex">Lucene Regex Search</a>, and one
                            could, if one wishesd so, use these instead of the NGram Index, but the
                            drawback here is that this would make searches quite slow and
                            resource-demanding. Choose your index wisely.</p>
                        <p>(With the string index, you can search for two strings within a certain
                            range of characters, say 10-50, which can be useful, but generally
                            speaking, the word index is much more powerful, though precisely this,
                            it cannot do.)</p>
                        <p>The texts Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā (and its commentaries), Aṣṭāvakragītā,
                            Brahmapurāṇa, Carakasaṃhitā, Nyāyabhāṣya, Padārthadharmasaṅgraha,
                            Pātañjalayogaśāstra, Rājamārtaṇḍa or Bhojavṛtti, Rasaratnasamuccaya,
                            Suśrutasaṃhitā, Tattvavaiśāradī, and Vākyapadīya all basically divide
                            strings into what can be called words (though with different rules for
                            dealing with sandhi phenomena), so here the word index will be of
                            greatest use. For the rest of the texts, words will be run together, so
                            here you will have to use the string index, unless you are sure that you
                            know the complete string you are searching for.</p>
