                <h3>Search Interface</h3>
                <section>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Layout</h4>
                        <p>The main page of the SARIT web platform displays a list
                            of the texts in the SARIT corpus and the search interface. </p>
                        <img src="resources/img/search-interface.png"/>
                        <p>The list of texts note the putative author and whether the text used
                            Devanagari script or romanisation - most texts exist in both scripts,
                            one converted from the other.</p>
                        <p>The search interface, located on the
                            right, offers a number of choices, among these to search based on the
                            information displayed in the list.</p>
                        <p>There are also links for downloading the texts in various formats: epub,
                            pdf and xml (zipped).</p>
                        <p> The last link gives the possibility of
                            opening the text in another app, eXide. eXide also allows you to perform
                            searches using XPath and XQuery, the main programming languages used in
                            the SARIT application, but that is a long story ….</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Search Term</h4>
                        <p>The <em>search term</em> is of course where you will be actively seeking
                            occurrences in the SARIT corpus of words or phrases you are interested
                            in. All the other choices you make in the search interface restrict or
                            modify the search you define in this way. </p>
                        <p>Generally speaking, there are two ways you can enter a search term:
                            either you enter a string of characters which you wish to find verbatim,
                            or you use regular expressions, masking your search expression by use of
                            wildcards, etc. However, in this search interface there are in fact more
                            options, for e.g. performing proximity searches, as explained in the <a href="search-help-lucene.html">Lucene Search Help</a>.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Search Targets</h4>
                        <p>You can choose <em>which texts</em> to target in your search in two
                            different ways.</p>
                        <p>In order to select individual texts to search in,
                            you can click the checkboxes to the left of their titles.</p>
                        <p>Note
                            that if you do not make any choice, you will search in all available
                            texts – there is no need to click all checkboxes in order to perform a
                            search throughout all texts.</p>
                        <p>If you wish to make selections among
                            the texts based on their script and/or author, you use the two last
                            dropdowns on the right part of the search interface, as explained
                            below.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Index</h4>
                        <p>This is where it gets a little technical ….</p>
                        <p>All searches in SARIT go through an index, which is basically like the
                            index of a book, only it contains lookups for each and every word or
                            string of characters.</p>
                        <p>The NGram Index analyses the text in terms of strings, regardless of any
                            word divisions.</p>
                        <p>The Lucene Full-Text Index analyses the text in terms of words, that is
                            strings as separated by spaces, etc.</p>
                        <p>When you search with the NGram Index, you will find all occurences of
                            your search term, regardless of whether it occurs as a whole word (that
                            is, space-separated string) or as only part of it.</p>
                        <p>When you search with the Lucene Full-Text Index, you will find all
                            occurences of your search term that are identical with whole words (that
                            is, space-separated strings), not as only part of it.</p>
                        <p>The Lucene Full-Text Index is thus useful if the text is segmented into
                            words, that is, divided somehow into chunks that resemble words in
                            European languages (sandhi phenomena are just one aspect of Sanskrit
                            that makes this a little complicated …).</p>
                        <p>The texts Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā (and its commentaries), Aṣṭāvakragītā,
                            Brahmapurāṇa, Carakasaṃhitā, Nyāyabhāṣya, Padārthadharmasaṅgraha,
                            Pātañjalayogaśāstra, Rājamārtaṇḍa or Bhojavṛtti, Rasaratnasamuccaya,
                            Suśrutasaṃhitā, Tattvavaiśāradī, and Vākyapadīya all basically divide
                            the text into words, so with these the Lucene Full-Text Index can be
                            used with profit. Note that this does not mean that the NGram Index
                            cannot be used – the two indexes make possible different searches.</p>
                        <p>With the remaning texts, the NGram Index should be used.</p>
                        <p>There are further explanations in the <a href="search-help-index.html">Indexes and Searching Help</a>.</p>
                        </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Search Mode</h4>
                        <p>You have a choice among <em>search modes</em>. These
                            will be explained in more detail below, but the most common ones are
                            "Any Search Term" and "All Search Terms". The first option is default,
                            so if you do not make any choice, you will automatically search for any
                            search term. What this means is that you want a hit no matter if one or
                            the other of the words you input as search terms is present, or if both
                            are, whereas if you search for all search terms, you only want hit if
                            all of the words you input are present.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Search is performed in a number of <em>fields</em> - to be more exact, in
                        indexes based on certain fields. This contrasts with searches in a word
                        processing document which are made in a document as a whole, as one long
                        string of characters.</p>
                    <p>Shakespeare's works consist of plays and poems. Plays are made up of speeches
                        which then usually consist of lines (and notices about who the speaker is),
                        and here each speech is indexed as a whole. This means that of you search
                        for the co-occurrence of two words, say "snake" or "fillet", you do not
                        search in the play as a whole, but you get a hit only if the two words occur
                        in the same speech. Poems are made of stanzas which also consist of lines,
                        and if you search for the occurrence of "bounty" and "boundless" near each
                        other, you search inside a certain stanza, not inside a poem or the Sonnets
                        as a whole.</p>
                    <p>The <em>search scope</em> here described is the default "narrow" search
                        scope. If you choose, you can search more broadly, in the divisions which
                        the speeches or stanzas are part of. This means, in the case of plays, that
                        you search within acts, and in the case of poems, that you search within
                        poems as a whole. If you do so, the co-occurrence of two words can span
                        several speeches and you may search for words which are within, say, 10
                        words of each other, though they belong to different stanzas. Both kind of
                        search scopes are useful for certain tasks.</p>
                    <p>You have the option to perform your search in different <em>works types</em>
                        – instead of selecting works individually, you can select groups such as
                        tragedies or poems. Here you can choose several different options.</p>
                    <p>This may seem obvious, but you search for <em>words</em> - spaces and
                        punctuation and so on cannot be searched for, but only the words themselves.
                        Also, the words are all lower-cased, so while this means that there is no
                        way to differentiate between "Hamlet" (the proper name) and "hamlet" (a
                        village), you also do not have to remember that "fillet" occurs first in a
                        sentence in the second witch's speech and therefore is in upper-case. All
                        your input is stripped of punctuation and lower-cased, so you can just as
                        well spare yourself the effort to input them – whether you search for "To
                        be, or not to be" or "to be or not to be" is all the same. Often words like
                        "to be or not to be" are removed from indexes, but not in the Shakespeare
                        app.</p>
                    <p>One may ask: if spaces cannot be searched for, what are phrase searches?
                        Don't phrases consist of words with spaces and punctuation in between? Yes,
                        but when you search for a phrase, this is not the same as when you search
                        for a phrase in a word processing document – with Lucene, you actually
                        search for a sequence of words which have no words in between them, so
                        everything is about words after all (and a phrase search is actually a
                        proximity search – more about that later).</p>
