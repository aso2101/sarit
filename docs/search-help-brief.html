        <h3>Brief Search Help</h3>
        <section>
            <p>Some brief hints are given here — for fuller explanations, please consult the other
                search instructions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are you searching for all occurrences of a certain string? <ul>
                        <li>Search using the NGram Index.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Do you want to use Regular Expressions? <ul>
                        <li>With both NGram Index and Lucene Full-Text Index, use standard regex
                            syntax for ".", "?", "+" , "*", "[]" and "{}". </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Do you want to search for the co-occurrence of a number of words? <ul>
                        <li>Check whether the texts are divided into words, and if they are, select
                            Use Lucene Full-Text Index and select All Search Terms Together. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Note that searching for expressions in one script does not (yet) search for the
                    equivalent expression in other scripts.</li>

            <h4>What Does It Mean?</h4>
            <p>If you hover over the dropdowns in the Search panel, you will see the titles of the
                dropdowns.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Search For What? <ul>
                        <li>You can either enter the precise term to search for or use Regular
                            Expressions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Use Which Index? <ul>
                        <li>Select Use NGram Index if the texts you are searching are not segmented
                            into words or if you want to be sure that you find each and every
                            occurence of a string. In general, use this index with all texts in
                            Devanagari.</li>
                        <li>Select Use Lucene Full-Text Index only if the texts you are searching
                            are segmented into words. This applies to a few texts in romanisation,
                            mainly the Arthaśāstra. For information about the remaining texts, see
                                <a href="search-help-word-division.html">Word Division</a>. </li>
                        <li>Selecting Use Lucene Full-Text Index gives you extra options, shown in
                            the dropdown menu Use Which Search Mode? </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>This dropdown menu is only visible if you have selected Use Lucene
                            Full-Text Index. </li>
                        <li>Any Search Term <ul>
                                <li>If you have entered several words to search, hits will also be
                                    retrieved where only one of the terms appear, but the hits with
                                    occurrences of many search terms will be displayed at the top of
                                    the hitlist. </li>
                                <li>This is the default search mode, so use it also if you are only
                                    searching for one word. </li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>If you have entered several words to search, hits will only be
