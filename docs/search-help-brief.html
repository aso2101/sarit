            <p>Some brief hints are given here — for fuller explanations, please consult the other
                search instructions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are you searching for all occurrences of a certain string? <ul>
                        <li>Search using the NGram Index.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Do you want to use Regular Expressions? <ul>
                        <li>With both NGram Index and Lucene Full-Text Index, use standard regex
                            syntax for ".", "?", "+" , "*", "[]" and "{}". </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Do you want to search for the co-occurrence of a number of words? <ul>
                        <li>Check whether the texts are divided into words, and if they are, select
                            Use Lucene Full-Text Index and select All Search Terms Together. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If you input a IAST search term or Devanagari search term, your search term will
                    by default be automatically converted to make your search apply to texts both in
                    IAST and in Devanagari. If you wish to choose whether to search using IAST or using Devanagari, see below.</li>

            <h4>What Does It Mean?</h4>
            <p>If you hover over the dropdowns in the Search panel, you will see the titles of the
                dropdowns.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Search For What? <ul>
                        <li>You can either enter the precise term to search for or use Regular
                            Expressions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Use Which Index? <ul>
                        <li>Select Use NGram Index if the texts you are searching are not segmented
                            into words or if you want to be sure that you find each and every
                            occurence of a string. In general, use this index with all texts in
                            Devanagari.</li>
                        <li>Select Use Lucene Full-Text Index only if the texts you are searching
                            are segmented into words. This applies to a few texts in romanisation,
                            mainly the Arthaśāstra. For information about the remaining texts, see
                                <a href="search-help-word-division.html">Word Division</a>. </li>
                        <li>Selecting Use Lucene Full-Text Index gives you extra options, shown in
                            the dropdown menu Use Which Search Mode? </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                            Full-Text Index. </li>
                        <li>Any Search Term <ul>
                                <li>If you have entered several words to search, hits will also be
                                    retrieved where only one of the terms appear, but the hits with
                                    occurrences of many search terms will be displayed at the top of
                                    the hitlist. </li>
                                <li>This is the default search mode, so use it also if you are only
                                    searching for one word. </li>
                            </ul>

                            with your original (IAST) search term.</li>
                    <li>This applies the other way 'round as well, so:</li>
                        <li>If you enter a search term in Devanagari and choose "Search with
                            Devanagari and IAST", you search term will be converted to IAST
                            and your search will include both your original (Devanagari) search term
                            and the search term converted into IAST.</li>
                        <li>If you enter a search term in Devanagari and choose "Search with IAST",

                            performed with the original (Devanagari) search term, only with the
                            search term converted into IAST.</li>
                        <li>If you enter a search term in Devanagari and choose "Search with
                            Devanagari", the search term will not be converted and your search will
                            only be performed with your original (Devanagari) search term.</li>
                    </ul>
